Final project for **MSDS621** and extension of ULMFiT for text tagging.

This project reviews the standard methods in text tagging and experiments extending the approach proposed in [Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification (ULMFiT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) while integrating the modifications in a local copy of the [FastAI](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) library. 

The files/folder contained in this repo are:

* `fastai/ directory`: Contains the modified verion `1.0.31` of the fastai library to inlcude text tagging.
* `ULMFiT_approach`: A notebook with an execution of the Labeler (on working results) and some of the functions integrated in the library.
* `Data_preprocessing_visualization_new.ipynb`: A notebook with Data preprocessing, visualization for the presentation
* `final_project_checkin_template.ipynb`: first machine learning model fitting
* `baseline_optimization.ipynb`: A notebook with grid search and pipeline to tune the machine learning algorithms

The extension of the approach proposed in ULMiT to this task is still an ongoing project. While a working version has been constructed the models results still need to be improved.
